Definition of terms.
In order to comprehend every bit of content present in this thesis, the following terms were used to mean the following:

Community radio: According to Fleming (2002), community radio is a non- profit agency which is meant to serve specific local communities and broadcasts content related to the demands of a community it serves. According to UNESCO, community radio is a non- profit radio owned by the community and help in amplifying voice of the community by allowing for public participation at all levels. In this case Umoja Radio is  radio station that serves the interests of young people in Umoja area operated by youth themselves in English and Kiswahili while also incorporating other vulger languages popularly used by Kenyan youth.

Community: According to Robert Stebbins (1987), community is a group of people residing in the same locality with different characteristics but shares common interest, beliefs and values. In this case, residents of Umoja are a community, who came together with the interest of setting up a media outlet. to serve them for their common good.

Empowerment: According to Simon (1994) empowerment is the ability of individuals or groups to stand up and take action for their own good. Individuals have power in their hands to make decisions that favors them. In this case, the act of setting up a community radio by umoja youth, is an example of economic empowerment.


ABSTRACT/ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Radio has proved to be a unique tool in disseminating information and skills that have sought to empower individuals in the community. Umoja Radio provides a platform to youth and the communitiey to air local voices on issues concerning Health, Nutrition, Education, Agriculture, relationships, financial literacy etc. 

This thesis was focused on exploring the role played a radio platform in empowering young people which then leads to growth and development of society to be able to sustain themselves in communities. For this reason, the study focused on Umoja Radio situated in Umoja 1 location, Embakasi constituency, Nairobi County.  

This radio came into existence after a group of eight youths  saw the need of having media channel that could help amplify their voices about the issues that concerned them and the community as a whole. The radio operates under a slogan, “Where good times last forever." which meant Voice of entertainment and Development. 

The study objectives were as follows; to examine how programs aired by Umoja Radio impact youth and to examine challenges faced by Umoja Radio in empowering young people and other community members. . The study was guided by two theories which included; Modernization Theory and Agenda Setting Theory. 

The study carried out was quantitative for it focused on requesting for individual’s thoughts, ideas and measure their perception, attitudes, behavior, and values in regard to the topic under study and it adopted a descriptive research design. 

The study population was of residents in Embakasi area who are the key audience. The study selected sample size of 300 community members of age 18-60 who are knowledgeable of operations at Umoja Radio. The researcher used Simple random sampling to select samples of people living in Umoja location and sampling was random to ensure equal chances of selection of the respondents. 

Data was collected by administering questionnaires to the respondents. Reliability and validity of the questionnaire was tested before administering the questionnaires. Data collected was analyzed quantitatively and presented in form of tables, graphs and charts. 

The study will eventually discuss the summary of the findings in the last chapter, give the recommendations and the researcher’s conclusion over the topic then recommend areas for further studies. At the end, the references that guides the study will be presented then appendices that will seek to guide the study.

Chapter 1
INTRODUCTION
This chapter covers the following; background of the study, statement of the problem, aim of the study, Objectives of the study, research questions, significance of the study and limitation of the study and organization of chapters.
Background of the study

Radio plays a vital role in regards to the empowering communities through its messages. Establishment of radio in a society serves as a reflection of growth and development as communities have the rights to seek and receive information and at the same time sharing out their view concerning different issues (Chapman et al 2003). Radio has served as a tool that allows for participation and this is geared towards development both economic and socially (Kumar 2004). 

A media platform helps amplify individuals' voices, equip them with useful knowledge that fosters empowerment. It should be accountable to the locals it serves, by allowing locals to manage and participate in the content creation and structuring of the radio programs.



Radio and community development
Availability of radio plays a significant role at grassroots level by ensuring crucial groups/rural areas are empowered and developed. This can be achieved through the programming of a community radio to ensure that education matters, gender inequality issues, food security among others are first prioritized when programming a radio operations.

In Northern Ghana, Chapman et al (2003) found out that radio was effective in fostering agricultural development by imparting agricultural knowledge in locals in their own language. According to Diedong and Naaikuur (2012) Royal FM a community radio in Ghana, was able to mobilize locals to conserve the environment through educative programs on impacts that come with illegal timber logging. 

The program also touched on the government’s role in accordance to streamlining timber logging operations on Ghanaian communities. According to Graham (1995)  radios have played a role of packaging interesting news related to the needs of the marginalized communities. They adopted variety of approaches in producing interesting news from their reporters and the Ghana News Agency newspaper and other local stations and make them local to empower people with knowledge at grass root level.


According to Shama (2011) radio has contributed a role of empowering local people in Zambia to hold accountable of their leaders. This is through putting forward programs that propagate issues of local people on both public and political agenda. According to Hughes and Pringle (2003) radios have impacted the development of democratic rights of individuals. 

This is through engaging locals in civil education before and during election. In Mozambique’s 2004 general elections, community radio worked hard by educating people on importance of exercising their democratic right through voting. As a result many people participated in voting and maintained peace throughout the period.
History of community radio in Kenya

The first community radio was established in Pacifica Foundation in 1949 in the United States. In Kenya, the community radio was set up in Homabay in May 1982 (J, Ilboudo 2003). It was formed as a result of UNESCO and the Kenyan Government coming together. It was to act as a trial in regards to establishing a low cost radio to serve the locals with information on daily happenings at the national level. 

The radio was then shut down after two years of operation following disagreement from the serving government which put a complain thet the radio was not promoting national languages but rather Luo language. The government was concerned that the radio was propelling division among different ethnic group of Nyanza Province (Fraser and Estrada 2001).

Following closure of Homabay community radio, a group of women in Ukambani formed radio listening groups on agriculture and reproductive matters. Through this, women realized the need to set up a radio station in their own locality that airs programs in their local language to better their understanding of issues affecting them, forming radio Mang’elete in Makueni county, Kenya. Fast fowards to 2023, we discovered there's a media vacuum in Eastern part of Nairobi, Embakasi constituency specifically Umoja area. 

It is thus that the idea of creating a youth  empowerment  media avenue was born to advocate for welfare of our young generation. The contemporary world has seen youth face various limitations in navigating through life ranging from substance abuse, joblessness, financial illiteracy and engagement in unlawful acts. Umoja Radio therefore intends to illuminate awareness on the need of an inclusive societal participation irregardless of age gaps.




History of Umoja Radio.


Initially, Kennedy Irungu, our C.E.O used to host live shows on social media platforms as he was highly passionate in media practice. In the process he met and engaged with players from different media outlets enriching his knowledge on the field. At the time, the idea of starting a radio had not surfaced in his mind. His relentless consistency saw him gain an audience base in Tiktok through his show dubbed #SecondswithKario. As time advanced he picked a co-host to make the presentation more appealing.

It continued to age well as Kennedy started to assemble young people whom they share interest and future goals. Coming together opened eyes to the gap of a media outlet in Umoja location giving birth to Umoja Radio. 

Broadcasted shows include:
#SecondswithKario 
#Highsandlows
#WildClutchWednesday.
#UmojaRadioMtaani- community based
#UmojaReality
Umoja Radio is committed to positively impacting community and highlighting plight of the youth.


Statement of the problem 
We have reviewed the literature to be familiarized with already existing work related to dimensions of community radio and how it seeks to empower youth. This is to identify gaps that still exists in the literature. The literature reviews we have interacted with earlier are based on challenges facing radio stations such as managerial studies of community, public and commercial radios and studies on their financial instability.

In the present research study, this thesis paid attention to mass media and how it sought to capture elements of empowerment through community radio. Empowerment as an aspect, is geared towards development. It has the ability to give voice to the marginalized people youth and women from local communities to take part in development activities. Empowerment as a term has been assigned many definitions by different authors and scholars. According to Narayan (2002), Nair and White (1993) empowerment is focused on striving to transform lives of marginalized and community through information and distribution of resources to influence behavioral change in the community. 

Yalala N (2005) stipulates that Community radios are ranked third after public and private radio in terms of broadcasting. Community radios are for the community and by the community. It is the community that owns the radio and the radio serves the interest of the locals. Community Radio amplifies the voices of locals which is not prioritized in the mainstream media.

What is mainly ailing any given country, if is the disseminated information do reach the rural people (Naaikuur and Diedong 2014). This poses the marginalized to the risk of being less empowered. Community radio therefore bridge gaps by addressing the needs of local communities and uplifting even those who are illiterate. The provided information by community radio such as Radio Mang’elete empowers women of Nthongoni by raising awareness of the challenges hindering them and offer possible solutions to those problems. It ensures participation of the locals in development activities that seeks to elevate community to greater level. Therefore it is evident that participation of the women and empowerment go hand in hand and are both are essential for development of a community. 

 According to Oriare and Mshidi (2010) there is no commitment among mass media in regards to developing the audience. Power rests with individual who own media and editorial staffs. Walter and Manji (2008) argues that community radio disseminate scarce information on youth and more over youth are never involved in the litmtle information given about them. Umoja Radio in this case is geared to exceptional performance. The thesis will focus on investigating the role Umoja Radio plays in empowering youth despite the fact that there is existence of mainstream media which speed up information dissemination the in the region.	 



Aim of the study

The main purpose of this study was to gather essential information that help in understanding how Umoja Radio as a community radio has strived  harder to empower youth in Embakasi constituency, Nairobi.

Research Objectives. 

To identify youth participation in empowerment programs aired by Umoja Radio.
To examine challenges faced by Umoja Radio in empowering youth. 
To identify initiatives which have the potential of positively transforming livelihoods of youth.

Research questions 
How do youth participate in empowerment programs aired by Umoja Radio? 
What are the challenges faced by Umoja Radio in empowering youth?
Which initiaves can be enacted to tap into hidden potential of young generation?
Significance of the study.


Apart from engaging in this thesis as a requirement for establishing a community radio in Umoja, the study was to help foster the understanding of the role played by Radio  in regards to empowering youth. This thesis was therefore to be helpful in gauging how effective a community radio is in empowering young generation as compared to mainstream media.

The study served to outline the position a community radio holds in the society and as such  guide the locals on how best to utilize community radios around them so as to grow themselves.

The study helped in imparting knowledge in individuals who do not conceal inputs of youth in different professions but to understand the capability of women youth in media industry.

Future researchers and scholars will find our thesis helpful in their study for they will have an already well researched literature review. This thesis will also act as a reference material and will therefore trigger interest among intellectualists that will foster advanced research about this work.
 Scope of the study

The study dwelled on the role of community radio in empowering women in Umoja location, Nairobi County. More specifically the study focused on Umoja Radio. The study was not limited to only youth but also other community members residing in Umoja since it is the radio station set up by only youth in the region.
Limitation of the study

Inadequate finances and time to sample the whole of Nairobi County. This is the reason as to why the study picked a sample size of 300 people from Umoja location where the radio is situated as to achieve the best results.
Respondents in this study range across different age groups with youth forming the majority.

The sample size was only 300 respondents therefore the results may not be generalized.

Chapter 2.
Introduction 
This section focused on the theoretical frameworks that guides this thesis. The chapter, further expounded the empirical reviews of the problem by reviewing the literature that exists on the problem and lastly established the relationship that exists between dependent and independent variables in the conceptual framework.
 Theoretical Framework.

According to Corley and Gioia (2011)) defines a theory as a statement of concepts that draw the interrelationship as to why a phenomenon occurred. Therefore, in this thesis, the theories below were used to inform the study and they included: Modernization theory and Agenda setting theory.


Modernization Theory .
This theory was put forward by Daniel Lerner and Walt W Rosow. Those who coined this theory posits that there is need to disseminate huge amount of information concerning modern discourses through mass media to the subjects as to ensure transformation from traditional to modern society. Lerner and Walt argues that traditional practices, cultures and economies hinder development and this derail backward the third world countries which were considered underdeveloped. Lerner suggests that traditional practices should be dissolved so as to foster economic growth and development.

There was need to disseminate western messages to underdeveloped countries as to help them advance and this was geared towards first attempt to use communication for development purposes. The form of communication essential for development was termed as one way process where information flowed from western countries to rural mass audience. Lerner and Walt says that at that moment, mass media was considered to be powerful tool in shaping the society and that it allowed for faster exchange of information between the western people and the locals. However over the years, third world countries embraced modernity through setting up their own mass media platforms to exchange information, solve their problems and enlighten each other in order to develop.

For this reason, a group of 8 youth came together to set up Umoja Radio as their channel that could give them voice, address their grievances, enlighten each other on life's pressures, relationships, lifestyle and reproductive wellness . This was to fight traditions and existing cultures at the moment that were hindering them to progress. This eventually aims at fostering both social and economic growth among Umoja youth.


 Agenda setting theory
This theory was put forward by Dr. Maxwell McCombs and Dr. Donald Shaw in 1972. The theory stipulates that media acts as an agent that sets the agenda for the public through framing, filtering or consistently reflecting on an issue and eventually make an issue to be that of a public agenda. This theory posits that the media plays a major in giving much more attention to certain issues or events so as to be considered by the audience to be newsworthy or important hence influencing public opinion. The theory argues that the public thoughts are modified by the media not in regard to what they think but in line to what they think about.  

 The Agenda-Setting Theory stipulates that issues which are prominently highlighted and continuously stressed in the mass media are regarded as vital by those who consume media content. This sought to mean that the more a news story or event is covered in the media, the more important it becomes to the public.  
Based on this theory, this study will seek to analyze how young presenters at Umoja radio play a to anguage spoken by the people residing around.

Non- commercial: its point of establishment was not to make profit, but instead it was financed by the local people and donors such as Non-governmental Organizations.
Participatory: it is owned and managed by the relevant community. The locals also engage in content programming and production.


Participation in empowerment programs by Umoja Radio.

up by youth, it is evident that much of the content aired to the public, concerns age bracket of 18-35 years of age and this sought to make audience think about their importance.  


Empirical Review

In this section, the thesis focused on discussing the objectives that guides the problem of study. The study further explored the literature works that existed on my objectives as a means of finding solutions to the statement of the problem.

The concept of community radio has had numerous definitions over the years. However in this thesis, we will dwell on AMARC’s definition of a community radio as local, non- commercial and allows participatory of the locals in development programs.
According to the report of AMARC (2007) a community radio is distinguished by the following characteristics:


Local: it is limited to a certain geographical area and broadcasts it content based on the local 

 Youth participation is the active engagement of young people throughout their own communities. 


Youth, Learning and literacy.

UNESCO notes Youth involvement in the media spans a wide range of activities – from learning technical, production, writing, and reporting skills to developing and deconstructing media content. By engaging with the media, young people explore and learn about themselves and the world around them. 

In doing so they bring their own unique knowledge and perspectives. Several programmes as case studies were identified to explore how the praxis of media education is being carried out, especially among young adults in different regions of the world. Praxis may be understood “as a social or pedagogical process which enlists human efforts to understand the world more accurately in conjunction with a political will to transform social practices and relations” (Sholle and Denski, 1993). 
Umoja Radio can achieve active youth engagement through integrating them into committees with adults who can act as mentors. Youth engagement can lead to increased academic performance and improved social-emotional well-being. It helps young people build skills and networks that are valued in the workplace, and can thus be a source of economic mobility.

Via the roll out of Umoja Radio mtaani, young talents in the area who possess different gifts will be brought into limelight by showcasing their abilities through broadcasts. Involving youth in community development initiatives nurtures a culture of civic engagement and active citizenship. Young individuals develop a sense of social responsibility by participating in community projects, volunteering, and advocating for important causes. This is among the major reasons that gave birth to the idea of Umoja Radio.

Young Journalists in action.

As one of the primary forms of communication, media provides young people with a mode of self-expression that facilitates education and learning. Presentstion and Writing for instance becomes more than an act or a craft of putting down ideas on paper: rather in and through writing youngsters create a sense of identity and being-in-the-world. This self-expression takes many forms – personal, public, social, and creative – and engenders dialogue and participation. To young people the process of writing about their own self and the social world around them is the beginning of a life long journey of learning. 

Umoja Radio is committed to educating passionate young people on hosting reality shows, Radio presentations, reporting of developments and writing new stories. An important development in radio-based journalism, the increasing presence and use of new media – computers and the internet – have led to changes in how a on air programs are run catalysed by emergence of online Radio/TVs. This combination of different media commonly referred to as “mixed media” has generated excitement among youngsters at the various initiatives.

Apart from simplifying the mundane procedures and tasks and enabling quicker learning of skills, the mixed media offers unique innovative possibilities for the youngsters as journalists. Studies have indicated that media mixes not only “nurture the innovative, adventurous and pleasurable ways in which participants can explore the possibilities of media,” both in content creation as well as bringing together local and indigenous knowledge in dialogue with international and global ones. Some of the topics and themes explored by Umoja Radio initiative – health, relationships, substance dependence, environment, and children’s rights – are good examples of this. 

Challenges Faced By Umoja Radio In Empowering The Youth.

According to AMARC (2007), Community radios have over the years been faced with so many challenges. Most of the problems are directed to specific locality, regions or nations. The major challenge affecting Community Radios in Kenya is financial instability. According to BBC (2006) huge cost incurred in operating radios, high amount needed to purchase and maintain equipment and the fact that a community radio is non- commercial in nature. Nevertheless, community radio do not pay journalists and for this reason it requires the locals to volunteer. 

This brings about stiff competition from mainstream media as their journalists are motivated with the salary they are paid.  Community radios also fear being harassed by the government whenever their content may be thought to be compromising the security of the nation (BBC, 2006).   

Fairbairn and Rukaria (2009) in a survey undertaken by the Open Society Initiative of East Africa found that community radios faces numerous challenges. These include influence to political content, bad governance and lack of identity for community radio stations. Community radio at some point tend to forget their reason for formation and sought to compare themselves to commercial stations. 

Lack of good management, for the case of Radio Mang’elete, since it was formed by 33 women groups, there might be scramble for power from either of the groups to run the station. Failure to conduct audience research skills due to lack of finances is another challenge. This is essential for Radio Mang’elete to know what they ought to deliver to listeners as to garner wide range of listenership. 

Lack of the best programming skills and formats. Most CR stations majorly have a mix of calls in between programs and news items resembling commercial radio. This interferes with the listeners by lowering their morale of continuing listening to the radio station. High turnover of personnel, Radio Mang’elete utilizes volunteers in regard to operating and managing the radio. At some point the workers may quite job to look for green pastures since they are not paid and this interferes with the management of Mang’elete radio. 


Kamweru (2008) states that CR in Kenya is faced with strict legislative framework, lack of power supply in marginalized areas, narrow audience and involvement of conflict of interest in aired stories, technological challenges, inadequate resources and lack of knowledge on subjects handled as some individuals lack training in the field of journalism. 


Umoja Radio being a starting project is also facing various challenges which affect steadiness of its growth. The fact that it is an initiative of young people translates to lack of enough financial backing to run its operations. Community involvement projects like #UmojaRadioMtaani and Umoja Reality require enough monetary funding to consistently engage members of society. Umoja Radio also needs adequate equpments to fully operate as an official media platform - these include but not limited to microphones, cameras, mixing console et al.


Also, extra human resource is needed to undertake various roles that are essential in a media outlet in order to administer roles well.


High cost of living in the country makes majority of young people unwilling to volunteer hence posing a limitation in the recruitment process.
Conceptual Framework

The conceptual framework was founded to establish the relationship that exists between the dependent variable and the independent variables of the research. The conceptual framework are structured representation  from wide range of ideas to help the researcher establish the problem of study, its objectives and come up with suitable literature for the study (Smyth 2004). The conceptual framework adopted by this study, had both independent variables and dependent variables as shown in figure below:


Independent Variable.	Dependent Variable
Youth Empowerment 
	Participation of youth in programs of Umoja Radio.
	Challenges Umoja Radio faces in empowering youth
	Initiatives aimed at benefiting youth.





                                                       CHAPTER THREE
                                RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
 Introduction
This section consists of a research approach and design the researcher employed in this thesis, the study site, target population, sample population, data collection procedures, validity and reliability, data analysis and presentation, and ethical consideration.


 Research approach

The research approach used in this thesis was of quantitative in nature. In Quantitative research, the researchers do not form part of participants or respondents (Onwuegbuzie and Leech, 2005). The study focused on clearly describing the characteristics of respondents in terms of their reaction as to measure their understanding and thoughts over the topic of study.  This thesis used deductive research approach which relied on narrowing down the general problem to a more specific level based on its objectives. The data was collected in numerically and analyzed in statistical form. 


 Research design

According to Kerlinger (1986) research design is strategic plan seeking to specify methods and procedure of finding answers to research questions to enable variance control. The study adopted descriptive research design. Since the approach used in the study was quantitative, descriptive research design was appropriate as it was to help give description of behavior of population to be sampled, and current situation related to the topic of study. The descriptive research design is important for its ability to explore further and give more information about the topic of study, it allows one to be knowledgeable of the real life issues and it saves on time.


 Research Site.

The study was conducted in Umoja location, Embakasi constituency, Nairobi County. The locality was selected as an area of study because it is where Umoja Radio was situated and this means that Umoja location is where the mentioned radio enjoys wide range of listenership.


 Population Target

According to Creswell (2012) target population refers to group of people sharing some identified characteristics that a researcher can study. A research population is a generally refers to a sum of individuals exhibiting same characteristics whom the scientific questions are focused to (Castillo, 2009). In this thesis, the population of interest consisted of youth respondents from Umoja area where Umoja Radio  is situated. Since the radio was established by women and grow under women leadership, the study focused on women only so as to establish how far the radio has further their development in the community.


Sampling and sample size

According to Webster (1985) a sample is a portion of respondents picked from broad population to be studied in order to gather information of the general population. Sampling then means an act of making selection on few individuals from whole population from which judgment is made after being studied upon (Kothari, 2004). In this study, the researcher used a simple random sampling technique to select the sample from Umoja location. This was to increase the probability of each member of the population to stand a chance of being chosen. The study selected sample size of 300 people of age 18-60 who are knowledgeable of Umoja Radio programming and matters of operation. 


Data Collection.

Data collection refers to the steps the researcher engaged in to acquire data from the field related to the research (Kumar 2009). For this study, the researcher was guided by the procedure involved in obtaining the relevant data essential for the study. There are two major types of data; According to Wilson (2010), primary data is the first-hand information the researcher acquires from the respondents to pursue his or her study as secondary data is that which is from published work of other people. Questionnaires served as source of primary data whereas secondary data was obtained from reviewing literature works that have written before by the scholars concerning this topic (Kuada, 2012).


 Questionnaire used to collect primary data was issued one-on -one to the respondents from the area of study. They contained structured question with the allocation of 20 minutes for the respondent to answer. The researcher picked questionnaires to count them as to ascertain that all forms were handed over. 


 Validity and Reliability

 Validity is meant to measure the extent to which the design employed in the study is suitable for its purpose and whether conclusions made from the results are factual (Bannigan and Watson 2009).
 
  Kombo and Tromp (2006) stipulates that validity is evident through how the findings of research variables depicts accuracy. It is mainly determined by the presence or absence of systematic error in data. Validating of the questionnaire will be essential as to determine their credibility. 
 
 This was served to measure the ability of the tool meet the standard to test the topic under the study. To test the credibility of questionnaires, 10 respondents from Nthongoni location were selected and issued with the questionnaire. Afterwards, the tool was assessed if it met the requirements as to be employed in the study. Adjustments were made where necessary based on the results exhibited from conducted test.

 Reliability explains the consistent the results collected from the study. Mugenda and Mugenda, (2003) stipulates that, reliability is achieved by ensuring uniformity in testing procedures and the use of similar items on a measure.

5.3.1 Umoja Radio management and the local community 
The management of this community radio should take into consideration that the station was established as to empower youth  and so they have to schedule informational and educational programs at an appropriate time when young people  are free to interact with their radio sets/ gadgets  as to get informed, learn and develop themselves.


The station should engage in creating awareness on the issues of active participation of youth  in the aired programs such as talk shows and scheduling of interviews so that the target population who are youth and community are more involved in shaping the quality of programs aired, promote the station to the rest of community and more importantly evaluate its performance.


 The management should quickly address the challenges facing Umoja  Radio as a way of trying to revive the station to remain relevant to the Embakasi constituency locals.  All involved stakeholders such as the local community, donors such as NGO’s should put their heads together as to look for a long term solutions to the problems ailing Umoja Radio. The challenge of lacking quality programs and untrained journalists and many others need to be addres
 
 sed as to enable the growth and development of Umoja Radio to greater levels.
The locals of Umoja location should stop being dormant and act in haste to support the radio station its operations starting from program productions and giving feedback on sectors to be improved. 

Community members need to participate actively in all aspects of the station as to keep the radio relevant to the local members. For instance, local members of Umoja  should start paying annual membership fee to the Radio , donate funds to support the station’s operations and look for more donors to help fund the radio station as to grow and compete with commercial radio stations.


5.3.2 Recommendation on challenges faced by Umoja Radio

 Donors and the local community should offer financial support to the station, put forward payment of annual membership fee as to foster Umoja Radio  operation. 
 
 This will help the station in purchasing of more digital studio equipment, offer proper journalism trainings to the volunteering individuals as to acquire skills of running programs and afford to motivate their staff as to raise their morale to give best performance at work. 


The Government through its regulatory body, Communication Authority of Kenya should be on front in ensuring frequencies of community radio stations such as Umoja Radio are easily accessible, this will help free them from interference to be at per with commercial radios stations. 

Umoja Radio ought to stay on air as to fulfil its purpose of existence. The government should also free community radios from high taxation and licensing for they don’t make profits. This is to increase their lifespan of serving the local communities as to foster their development and that of the nation as a whole. 


5.4 Recommendation for further studies

 Studies have depicted community radios serve as powerful tools that plays a vital role of reaching out to local community members and the marginalized through offering them information in their own language, voicing their grievances and educating them on sensitive issues that contribute to their growth and development.
 
  For this reason, there is need for further research to be conducted as to gauge how efficient the community radios are acknowledging the needs of different groups / local communities in Kenya. 
  
  Therefore Umoja Radio is not exceptional. The scope of this study was limited to Umoja Location with only a small sample size 200 respondents. There is need to expand the on the sample size and engage in extensive research of the whole of Nairobi County. The sampled size used was not sufficient to conclude that Umoja Radio was impactful in empowering youth in Umoja area. 
  
  From the research above, it is evident there is a media vacuum in Embakasi constituency specifically Umoja location which needs to be filled.
